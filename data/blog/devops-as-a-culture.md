## DevOps as a culture

DevOps is often thought of as a set of tools and processes for automating software delivery, but it's also a culture that fosters collaboration and communication between development and operations teams. The objective of a DevOps culture is to break down silos between teams and promote a shared sense of ownership and responsibility for the software delivery process.

One of the key elements of a DevOps culture is its focus on continuous improvement. Teams are encouraged to continually evaluate and improve their processes and tools to make the software delivery process faster, more reliable and more efficient. This requires a culture of experimentation where teams try new things, fail fast and learn from their mistakes.

Another important aspect of the DevOps culture is transparency and openness. Teams are encouraged to share information and knowledge and make processes and tools visible to others. This improves collaboration and communication and builds trust between her members of the team.

A DevOps culture also fosters a sense of shared ownership and ownership of the software delivery process. Teams are encouraged to work together to identify and resolve any issues that may arise during the software development and delivery process. This requires a culture of trust where team members are willing to take risks and rely on each other to achieve common objective.

My personal experience as a software engineer trying to imbibe the devOps culture involves helping out in areas like setting up environment on staging and production, setting up and maintaining continuous delivery pipeline using circleCI, researching and proposing ways to improve the system which will ease the development to production process, monitoring production environment and troubleshooting errors that may arise.

One clear advantage of devOps as a culture is that there is continuous improvement of development process. As an example, I proposed in one of my previous organizations that each engineer be given his/her development server to run the code and serve as a two-factor UAT environment for testing the fix or feature added with a replica of the production environment before pushing it to production. This will in turn reduce bugs that are promoted to the production environment for users to see.

To soak up the DevOps culture and gain expertise in this area, I created a personal account on some popular cloud computing platforms and was able to experiment to my heart's content. This is not a capital intensive undertaking as most cloud platforms offer 6-12 months of free use of the basic tools that individuals or small businesses need. These experiments gave me the knowledge and confidence to improve our development process and also advocate that DevOps operations should be viewed as a cross-team work culture rather than as a role dedicated to one department.

#### Most of the skills needed as a DevOps engineer are:

- `Strong Linux/Unix administration skills`: Familiarity with command-line tools and basic system administration tasks is essential for a DevOps engineer.

- `Version control`: Understanding of version control systems such as Git is important for managing code and collaboration among developers.

- `Scripting skills`: Knowledge of at least one scripting language such as Python, Bash, Ruby, or Perl is essential for automating tasks and provisioning infrastructure.

- `Continuous integration and delivey tools (CI/CD)`: Familiarity with tools for automating the build and deployment process, such as Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI.

- `Containerization and orchestration`: Understanding containerization and orchestration concepts and tools like Docker and Kubernetes is important for managing and scaling applications.

- `Infrastructure as Code tools (IAC)`: Knowledge of tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Puppet to provision and manage infrastructure.

- `Cloud computing`: Familiarity with cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and GCP, and ability to deploy and manage applications in cloud environments

- `Networking`: Understanding networking concepts, protocols, and security best practices is critical to managing and troubleshooting problems encountered in a production environment.

- `Monitoring and logging`: Familiarity with monitoring and logging tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, and Elasticsearch to ensure application health and availability.

- `Problem solving and critical thinking`: DevOps engineers must be able to detect, troubleshoot and resolve issues quickly and effectively.

To enable a DevOps culture, the above skills are not just for operations teams to build, they are the responsibility of all parties (development and operations teams) from development to production lifecycle of an application. A DevOps culture includes a state of continuous learning and improvement rather than the final state of the application lifecycle.

### Conclusion

Implementing a DevOps culture in your organization requires the right leadership and support. This includes training and educating team members and adopting new technologies and practices. Additionally, it is important to have a clear understanding of the organization's goals and objectives and to align the organization's culture and practices with those goals.

In summary, a DevOps culture is a set of values and practices that foster collaboration, communication, and continuous improvement between development and operations teams. It aims to break down silos between teams and promote shared ownership and responsibility for the software delivery process. By implementing a DevOps culture, organizations can achieve faster, more reliable software delivery and improve the overall performance and scalability of their systems.
